# MNIST-classification-from-scratch
In this project, i build a classification model to classify MNIST dataset (28x28 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9) from scrath using only Numpy.
The goal of this project is to build a 2-layer neural network from the ground up to learn more about how it works, then experiment with various parameters such as epochs, initial weights and biases, learning rate, and the number of hidden units to see how each parameter affects the network's performance. At the conclusion of this research, I learnt about data biases: which class has more data than the others, the model tends to know more about that class and has the most accuracy.
